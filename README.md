# Introduction to Step-Expansion
This is an explanation on finding the single-source shortest path using a modifed breadth-first-search algorithm called  "step-expansion". Step-expansion can solve SSSP on graphs with varying edge weight. 
It accomplishes this by simulating extra steps in the traversal process by "expanding"
a large weighted edge into several segmented edges or "steps".

## Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in O(V + E*W) where W is the maximum edge weight in the graph.

## Effectiveness
The algorithm should be effective on any Directed Acyclic Graph. The algorithm is an improvement over na√Øve BFS SSSP. BFS SSSP will always produce correct output for any DAG if and only if edge weight is constant across all edges. BFS Step-Expansion SSSP corrects this. Therefore, BFSE is effective for any positive weighted DAG. I haven't tested negative edge weights.

## Algorithm
The algorithm introduces two new properties: factor
and step. In order to use step-expansion, a graph must track 
step for each edge. The algorithm can be optimized a bit by storing 
these values instead of finding them each time BFSE is called.

 * Factor: the minimum edge weight found in the graph
 * Step: A represenation of incremental traversal of a single edge

Step-Expansion(G, v):
    
    for each node n in G:            
        n.distance = INFINITY        
        n.parent = NIL

    factor = NIL                                        //initialize factor
    
    for each edge e in G                                //initialize step for each edge
        factor = min(factor, e.weight)                  //factor = minimum edge weight in graph
        e.step = e.weight                               //step for each edge is initialized to edge weight

    create empty queue Q      

    v.distance = 0
    Q.enqueue(v)                      

    while Q is not empty:        
    
        u = Q.dequeue()
    
        for each edge e from u to n:                    //process edges
            if e.step > factor                          //if edge requires stepping
                e.step = e.step - 1                     //step on edge
                Q.enqueue(u)                            //enqueue this vertex
            else if n.distance == INFINITY:             //else if node is not visited
                n.distance = u.distance + e.weight      //relax using weight of edge
                n.parent = u
                Q.enqueue(n)
                G.remove(n)                             //do not ever process this edge again
