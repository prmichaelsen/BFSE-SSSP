# Introduction to Step-Expansion
This is an explanation on finding the single-source shortest path using a modifed breadth-first-search algorithm called  "step-expansion". Step-expansion can solve SSSP on cyclic graphs with arbitrary edge weight. 
It accomplishes this by simulating extra steps in the traversal process by "expanding"
a large weighted edge into several segmented edges or "steps".

## Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in O(V + E*W) where W is the maximum edge weight in the graph. More precisely, the algorithm runs in O(V + E + W) time where W is the summation of all edge weights minus the total number of edges times the minimum edge weight. I use E + W because each edge e will be processed at least once and w as many times where w is the the difference between e.weight and the  minimum edge weight. Therefore complexity is the number of edges plus the number of additional times all edges had to be processed.

## Effectiveness
The algorithm should be effective on any Directed Acyclic Graph. The algorithm is an improvement over na√Øve BFS SSSP. BFS SSSP will always produce correct output for any DAG if and only if edge weight is constant across all edges. BFS Step-Expansion SSSP corrects this. Therefore, BFSE is effective for any arbitrarily weighted graph with or without cycles.

Formal proof and more inclusive testing is required to substantiate my claim that BFSE can produce correct output for any arbitrarily weighted graph with or without cycles. So far, in my limited testing, I have not discovered a counter-example.

## Algorithm
The algorithm introduces three new properties: factor, step, and ideal weight.
In order to use step-expansion, a graph must track 
step for each edge along with the factor and ideal weight for itself. 
The algorithm can be optimized a bit by storing 
these values instead of finding them each time BFSE is called.

 * Factor: the minimum edge weight found in the graph
 * Step: a represenation of incremental traversal of a single edge
 * Ideal weight: the summation of all negative edges in the graph

The algorithm can detect negative weight cycles if the weight of a path exceeds
the ideal weight of the graph. A path can only have weight smaller than 
the ideal weight of the graph if and only if there exists a negative cycle 
along the path.
